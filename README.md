# What does it do? Why is it open-sourced? 
The bot lets the user that needs support to DM the bot. After the user DMd the bot his/her problem, the bot will forward the message to the channel specified. I also made the project open-source for education purposes. I decided to use Python because I'm not that familiar with javascript. 

# How do I reply to the messages?
To reply to the user, simply write "r", "reply", "mail", or m after mentioning/using the bot's prefix. For example, if your prefix is "?", then you'd write "?reply [user that needs help] [message that you want to reply with]". 

# Independencies Used
discord.py and asyncio
